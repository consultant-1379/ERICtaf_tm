            <p>One important point to note is that both Automated and Manual test
                cases need to be created in TMS.
            </p>
            <p>A fundamental point in the ISTQB syllabus is that an automated test should be documented in the
                exact same manner as a manual test case.

                        <b>Requirement Id:</b>
                        either a valid Jira Epic or User

                        <b>A Unique Test Case Id:</b>
                        This is an Id that will
                        follow the test
                        case through test execution and reporting. The Id
                        should reflect
                        the epic, user story or feature you are testing. It
                        is a key
                        enabler for automatic trace-ability.
