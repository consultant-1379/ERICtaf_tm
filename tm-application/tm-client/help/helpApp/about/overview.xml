            <p> Test Management System (TMS) has the purpose of managing test cases, ensuring all product
                requirements
                are being covered by traceable test cases.
            </p>
            <p>It facilitates:
                <ul>
                <li>test case definition</li>
                <li>metadata association</li>
                <li>test case
                    grouping
                </li>
                <li>filtering.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <b>TMS main characteristics:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Web based (modern design - HTML5 + CSS2/3), using UI-SDK</li>
                <li>Ericsson branded</li>
                <li>High Availability Application Server / Database, hosted in Linkoping HUB</li>
                <li>Automatic Backups</li>
                <li>Scalable Solution</li>
            </ul>

            <p> TM ensures test case traceability, assigning a global unique ID to each test case on its creation.
                Test case ID is linked to parent requirement in the Requirement Management Tool (e.g.
                <xref format="html" scope="external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</xref>).
            </p>

            <p> TM has been designed in a modular approach and can be integrated into different Requirement
                Management Tools and IDEs, via plug-ins. At the moment, TAF TM is integrated with
                <xref format="html" scope="external" href="http://eteamproject.internal.ericsson.com">PDU OSS JIRA</xref>
                enabling the linking of
                TAF TM test cases to JIRA requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Why use TMS</b>
            </p>
            <p> TMS helps to ensure that all test cases and testware are identified and designed with great care.
                Without test case identification and proper description, over time, the traceability of why and by whom
                the test cases were created would be lost.
