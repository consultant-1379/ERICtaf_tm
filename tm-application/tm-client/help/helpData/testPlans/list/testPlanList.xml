                Test Campaigns may be filtered by product, drop, feature and components. Note: drops and components are only
                available for certain products.

            <p>
                Test campaigns may span multiple components and when filtering by component it should be noted that the the filter mechanism
                is a logical OR filter.
            </p>

                in the component dropdown.</i>
